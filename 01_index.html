                <p>
                    Chandra Shekhar Azad was born on 23 July 1906 in Bhabhra village as Chandra Shekhar Tiwari,
                    in a Brahmin family, in the princely-state of Alirajpur. His forefathers were from Badarka 
                    village of Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh. His mother, Jagrani Devi, was the third wife of
                    Sitaram Tiwari, whose previous wives had died young. After the birth of their first son, 
                    Sukhdev, in Badarka, the family moved to Alirajpur State.
                    <br><br>
                    His mother wanted her son to be a great Sanskrit scholar and persuaded his father to send 
                    him to Kashi Vidyapeeth at Banaras to study. In 1921, when the Non-Cooperation Movement was
                    at its height, Chandra Shekhar, then a 15-year-old student, joined. As a result, he was 
                    arrested on 20 December. On being presented before the Parsi district magistrate Justice 
                    M. P. Khareghat a week later, he gave his name as "Azad" (The Free), his father's name as
                    "Swatantrata" and his residence as "Jail". The angered magistrate punished him with 15 lashes.
